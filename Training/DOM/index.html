            computer programs. Some may build underlying operating systems, 
            while others may focus only on developing new mobile and desktop 
            applications. They also develop computer games and other digital architecture.
            A developer is a technology professional who works on, builds and creates 
            software, websites, applications and other systems. 
            Often, developers require a knowledge of coding to write and debug 
            source code for applications and software effectively.
